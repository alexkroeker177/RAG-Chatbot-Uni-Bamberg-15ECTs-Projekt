This Bachelor/Master thesis project aims to build a RAG-based chatbot to answer questions about university examination regulations. The goal is to make these often complex legal documents more accessible to students through a natural language interface, similar to ChatGPT.


Key Details
Technology: The core technology is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This involves a retrieval step to find relevant document sections before a large language model generates an answer.

Project Scope: The project involves three main parts:

A literature review on current RAG techniques, specifically those that provide source document links.


Applying selected techniques to create a question-answering system for the examination regulations of the Faculty of Information Systems and Applied Computer Sciences (WIAI).


Evaluating the performance of the chosen techniques.


Prerequisites: You need solid programming skills and a strong interest in machine learning and NLP.



Collaboration: The project will be done in collaboration with the examination board for Computer Science and Applied Computer Science.
